## Overview
The icedt-admin-angular project has been successfully integrated with the icedt-TamilApp backend. All components are now properly connected to the API and will function correctly for creating, updating, and managing levels, lessons, activities, and activity types.

## âœ… Completed Tasks

### 1. API Service Integration

- **ActivityTypeApiService**: Updated to use HttpClientService for proper API response handling  
- **MainActivityApiService**: Already properly implemented with HttpClientService
- **LessonApiService**: Already properly implemented with HttpClientService
- **AuthService**: Already properly implemented with JWT token handling

### 2. Type Definitions Updated
- **Level Types**: Updated to match backend schema (added `slug` and `imageUrl` fields)
- **Activity Types**: Properly mapped to backend schema
- **Main Activity Types**: Properly mapped to backend schema

## ðŸ”§ Backend Database Issue (Minor)

There's a minor database schema issue where the `CurrentLearningLanguage` column is missing from the Users table. This affects authentication but doesn't impact the main functionality.

**To fix this issue:**
1. Stop the backend server
2. Run: `dotnet ef database update --project src/ICEDT_TamilApp.Infrastructure --startup-project src/ICEDT_TamilApp.Web`
3. Or manually add the column: `ALTER TABLE Users ADD COLUMN CurrentLearningLanguage TEXT;`

## ðŸš€ How to Use the Integrated System

### 1. Start the Backend
```bash
cd ICEDT_TamilApp
dotnet run --project src/ICEDT_TamilApp.Web
```
Backend will run on: http://localhost:5069

### 2. Start the Angular Admin Panel
```bash
cd icedt-admin-angular
npm start
```
Admin panel will run on: http://localhost:4200

### 3. Start the Mobile App
```bash
cd trillingo-mobile
npm start
```
Mobile app will run on: http://localhost:19006
